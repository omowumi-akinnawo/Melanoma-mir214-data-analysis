# Data-Driven Analysis of miR-214-3p in Melanoma

## Project Overview
This project investigates oncogenic microRNA-214-3p as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma by integrating computational predictions, experimental validation, and statistical analysis.

## Problem Statement
MicroRNAs play a key role in cancer progression, but identifying biologically relevant targets requires combining multiple data sources and validating outcomes.
The goal of this analysis was to prioritise candidate gene targets of miR-214-3p and evaluate the impact of its inhibition on melanoma cell behaviour.

## Data Sources
- Computational target prediction tools (TargetScan, miRDIP, BioVenn, GENT2)
- RT-qPCR gene expression data
- Luminescence-based cell growth assay data

## Analytical Approach
- Integrated outputs from multiple computational tools to prioritise candidate targets  
- Designed an analytical workflow combining in silico prediction and experimental validation  
- Analysed RT-qPCR gene expression data to quantify differential expression  
- Applied statistical testing (two-sample t-test, p < 0.05) to assess significance  
- Visualised cell growth trends to evaluate treatment impact  

## Key Insights
- Identified consistent candidate targets associated with miR-214-3p across prediction tools  
- Observed statistically significant gene expression changes following miR-214-3p inhibition  
- Detected reduced melanoma cell proliferation post-transfection  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how integrating computational predictions with experimental data and statistical evaluation can support evidence-based decisions in translational research.

## Next Steps
- Automate analysis workflows using Python  
- Expand analysis with larger datasets  
- Develop clear visualisations for insight communication
